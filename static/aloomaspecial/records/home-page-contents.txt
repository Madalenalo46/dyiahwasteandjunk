There is a special kind of magic that happens when a community comes together to improve a shared space. A volunteer cleanup event is a powerful expression of collective pride. The most crucial tool for harnessing that volunteer energy is a central, visible goal. A roll off dumpster serves as that goal. It’s the physical representation of progress.
